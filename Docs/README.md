# CoT_Logger

This is a new Antigravity project.

## About

This project was created using Antigravity, a powerful agentic AI coding assistant designed by the Google Deepmind team working on Advanced Agentic Coding.

## Getting Started

More documentation will be added as the project develops.

## Usage

### 1. Automatic Diff Capture
The extension automatically tracks changes to your files.
- **Auto-Save Compatible**: It accumulates changes while you work.
- **WIP Entries**: Changes are stored as "Work in Progress" until you add reasoning.

### 2. Logging Reasoning (The "Seal")
To attach reasoning to your latest work:
1.  Copy your explanation/reasoning to the clipboard.
2.  Run the command: **`Reasoning Logger: Log from Clipboard`**.

### Recommended Hotkey Setup
For the best experience, bind `Log from Clipboard` to a key (e.g., `Ctrl+Shift+L`):
1.  Open Keyboard Shortcuts (`Ctrl+K Ctrl+S`).
2.  Search for `reasoning-logger.logFromClipboard`.
3.  Click the `+` icon and press your desired key combination.

Now you can just **Copy** -> **Hit Hotkey** to log!
